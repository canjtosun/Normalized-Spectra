# Normalized-Spectre

Welcome to Github!

Steps to contribute to this project:

1) Create a Github account.

2) Create your own branch, this allows any changes that you make to be on a seperate branch that will not affect the master file until it has been approved. 

3) To make an changes, you can choose to use other programs like Git Desktop for an easy interface or use Github itself by clicking on the file you want to make changes to in your branch, click the pencil at the top right, and paste the contents of the new file in the text box.
  - Another way of doing this is pressing the "Push" button and it will allow you to paste the updated files into the branch.
